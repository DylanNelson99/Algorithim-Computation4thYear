/*
sorted Merge array A(a[]) and array B(b[]) and an int size of A and size of B{
i = size of A - 1
j = size of B - 1

last index = (size of A + size of B) - 1

while j is gretaer than 0{
if {i is greater than 0 and a[i] is greater than array of B
A of last index = array a[i]
i decrements
}

A of last index = array b[j]
j decrements 
}
last index of buffer decrements
}


print array (int arr and size of A){
cout array A with B merged in
